# Heart-disease-classification-ML
I have created a Machine Learning project that predicts whether a patient has a heart disease or not.

The project is made using Scikit learn

Data used for training and testing: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease 

The model used is "Logistic Regression" 

The accuracy achieved is 89%
